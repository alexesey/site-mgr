    Memories broken
    The truth goes unspoken
    I’ve even forgotten my name
 </p>
<p>
    I don’t know the season
    Or what is the reason
    I’m standing here holding my blade
</p> 
<p>
    A desolate place
    Without any trace
    It’s only the cold wind I feel
</p>
<p>
    It’s me that I spite
    As I stand up and fight
    The only thing I know for real:
</p>
<p>

    There will be blood-shed
    The man in the mirror nods his head
</p>
<p>
    The only one left
    Will ride upon the dragon’s back
</p>
<p>
    Because the mountains don’t give back what they take
    Oh no
    There will be blood-shed
    It’s the only thing I’ve ever known
</p>
<p>
    Losing my identity
    Wondering: "Have I gone insane?"
    To find the truth in front of me
    I must climb this mountain range
    Looking downward from this deadly height
    And never realizing why I fight
